\section*{Fast Streaming Algorithm for MST (20 points)}

In the exercises of week 5, we discussed a streaming algorithm for computing a minimum spanning tree (MST) in $O(\log^2{n})$ passes. The goal of this question is to show a faster algorithm. Recall that in a $k$-pass streaming algorithm the algorithm is allowed to have $k$ passes over the input graph. 

Design a streaming algorithm for computing the MST of the graph, using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total memory and $O(\log{n} \log{\log{n}})$ passes. The algorithm can use randomization and should work with high probability. You can assume that the weights of the edges in the input graph are non-negative integers in $\{1, 2, \dots, n^{10}\}$.

\paragraph{Hint.} Note that if you want to compute outgoing edges from a small number of connected components, you can sample a large number of edges adjacent to each connected component without violating the memory constraints of the algorithm. Show how to exploit this.
